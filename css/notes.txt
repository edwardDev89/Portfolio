id and class selectors will overwrite tag selectors

div , span , img , a  is inline display element, it only affect with css and take space as its needed , not like block element such as <p> 
display inline and block (take up whole width) can change the element display type 
Display: none / visibility: hidden - hide the element

html class can specify more than 1 class under 1 element , example <h1 class ="class1 class2"
pseudo classes such as :active change status of element

id name must be unique in html page and only 1 id in an element
more specific selector

always use percent instead of fix width

static(default)
relative (doesn't affect other element when move from the edge itself)
absolute (move based on parent edge but not self edgee the element out from the flow and not inline block, it can move freely)
fixed (stay at same location when scroll down)

Coordinate => top,botom,left,right
